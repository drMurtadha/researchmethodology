# Module 2: Problem Formulation

## Module Learning Outcomes
1. Be able to understand what is a research problem.
2. Be able to understand the steps in formulating a research problem.
3. Be able to write about research problems.

## Module Outline
- What is Research Problem?
- Steps in formulating a research problem.
- Stating research problems.

## Part 1: What is a Research Problem?
- A research problem is a gap between what is and what ought to be.
- Use exploratory research to define the background of the problem.
- Determine whether the problem should be tackled.
- Find out why the solution is being sought.
- Determine whether the solution already exists.
- Determine relevant factors and aspects of the problem.
- Formulation means translating and transforming the selected research problem into a scientifically answerable research question.
- Problem solving has two phases: (1) Defining the problem, (2) Finding the solution.

### Characteristics of a Good Research Problem
- **Interesting**: Keeps the researcher interested throughout the research process.
- **Researchable**: Can be investigated through the collection and analysis of data.
- **Manageable**: Fits the level of the researcher's skill set, available resources, and time restrictions.
- **Significant**: Addresses a real concern, demonstrates a tangible problem, or otherwise contributes to the field of study.

### Research Problem Example
- Eg: Anomaly Detection in WSN (Wireless Sensor Networks).
- General Background / Problem → Statement of Problem / Analysis → Research Questions → Research Objectives → Hypothesis.

## Part 2: Developing Problem Statement
- When a problem has been formulated, it can be represented as a statement of the problem.
- The problem statement can be written in one sentence or can be a few paragraphs long, extending to more than a page.
- It is a specific declaration that summarizes the point of view of your research.
- It should also justify the problem.

### Steps in Writing Problem Statement
1. **Contextualize the Problem**: The problem statement should frame your research problem in its particular context and give some background on what is already known about it.
2. **Show Why It Matters**: Address the relevance of the research: why is it important that the problem is solved?
   - For practical research, focus on the concrete details of the situation (who is affected, when and where does it occur, what attempts have been made).
   - For theoretical research, think about the scientific, social, geographical, or historical background (how much is already known, what key aspects remain unresearched, what controversies exist).
3. **Set Your Aims and Objectives**: Frame how you intend to address the problem. Your goal should not be to find a conclusive solution, but to seek out the reasons behind the problem and propose more effective approaches.

### Practical Research Problems
- Directly relevant to a specific issue, occupation, policy, or practice.
- Example: Voter turnout in region X has been decreasing steadily over the past ten years, in contrast to other areas of the country. According to surveys conducted by organization Y, turnout is lowest among under-25s and people on low incomes. There have been some effective attempts at engaging young people in politics through social media, but these engagement efforts have yet to result in increased voter turnout.
- Low voter turnout has been shown to have negative associations with social cohesion and civic engagement, and is becoming an area of increasing concern in many European democracies. When specific groups of citizens lack political representation, they are likely to become more excluded over time, leading to an erosion of trust in democratic institutions. Addressing this problem will have practical benefits for region X and contribute to understanding of this widespread phenomenon.

### Theoretical Research Problems
- Have broader significance for understanding our world.
- Example: In the past ten years, the “gig economy” has become an increasingly important segment of the labor market. Young people between 18 and 29 are more likely to be employed in this sector than other groups, and the instability of this type of work may have wide-ranging effects on their lives. While some commentators have hailed the gig economy as a flexible alternative to traditional employment, others point out that gig work often offers low pay, few protections, and high levels of precariousness.
- In the literature on the gig economy, these new forms of employment are sometimes characterized as a flexible active choice and sometimes as an exploitative last resort. To understand their nature, we need to learn more about the motivations and experiences of people working gig jobs.

### Common Mistakes in Problem Statement
- The problem to investigate is not stated clearly enough.
- The scope is too broad or too narrow.
- The problem is not researchable or testable.
- The lead sentence does not clearly identify the problem or issue leading to the study.
- Indicate why the problem is important.
- Focus the problem statement on the key concept being tested or explored.
- Refrain from using quotes in the lead sentence.

### Example Problem Statements
- **Control Chart Patterns**: The on-line recognition of control chart patterns (CCPs) may encounter a continuum of situations which can cause various types of changes in manufacturing process. Therefore, there is a need for a robust CCP recognition system that can handle various types of CCPs, noisy data and non-random disturbances in order to detect and recognize CCPs as early as possible.
- It is crucial that control chart patterns be recognised as they are developing so that the appropriate corrective action can be taken quickly to avoid production of defective items.

### Iteratively Refining Research Question Example
| Research Question | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| Q1. What effect does daily use of Twitter have on the attention span of under-16s? | The question is focused on the effects of Twitter use on a specific group. |
| Q2. What effect does daily use of social media have on the attention span of under-16s? | Broader to social media in general. |
| Q3. What effect does social media use have on people's minds? | Too broad, no specific group or effect. |

## Part 3: Formulating Research Questions and Hypothesis
### Research Questions
- Do I know the field and its literature well?
- What are the important research questions in my field?
- What areas need further exploration?
- Could my study fill a gap? Or lead to greater understanding?

#### Types of Research Questions
1. **Existence**: Designed to systematically rule out rival explanations (e.g., Does X exist?).
2. **Description and Classification**: What are the characteristics of X? Or what are the types of X?
3. **Composition**: What are the factors that compose X?
4. **Relationship**: Are X and Y related? Do occurrences of X correlate with occurrences of Y?
5. **Descriptive-Comparative**: Expected that researcher will ensure that all groups are comparable.
6. **Causality**: Does X cause Y? Does X prevent Y?
7. **Causality-Comparative**: Does X cause more Y than does Z? Is X better at preventing Y than is Z?

#### Testable Research Questions
- Preceding questions, while unquestionably relevant, are not testable as research questions.
- Very weak: Is the new technique any good?
- Weak: Is the new technique better than the old one?
- Better: Is the new technique faster than the old one?
- Better still: Does the new technique take less than 95% of the time taken by the old one?

#### Examples of Research Questions
- How can the Accuracy of the Recommender Systems be improved by exploiting user preference and contextual information?
- How to design a vehicle acquire accurate context information in a dynamic and uncertain environment?

### Hypothesis
- A hypothesis is a proposed explanation or statement that can be tested through research and experimentation.
- Hypotheses are formulated to explain observed phenomena or to make predictions about the outcomes of experiments.

#### Example Hypothesis
- Algorithm A will provide more accurate classification of breast cancer compared to Algorithm B when applied to DNA sequence.

#### Characteristics of a Strong Hypothesis
- Give insight into a research question.
- Are testable and measurable by the proposed experiments.
- Each hypothesis is matched with a specific aim and has rationale.

#### Formulating Research Question/Hypothesis
- A well-thought-out and focused research question leads directly to your hypotheses.
- Hypotheses give insight into a research question.
- Are testable and measurable by the proposed experiments.
- Each hypothesis is matched with a specific aim and has rationale.

#### The Thesis Statement
- States your position on a research question once you’re working on the question.
- This is what you plan to argue or prove in your paper.

## Part 4: Research Aim
- The Research Aim (or Research Purpose) is a statement that shapes the direction and focus of the research.
- It gives a specific and accurate synopsis of the overall purpose of the study.
- It must align with the thesis title and main contribution.

### Why Research Aim is Crucial
- It articulates the relevance and significance of your research topic within the existing body of knowledge.

### Examples of Research Aim
1. The aim of this research is to develop and enhance hybrid linear-nonlinear multivariate time series forecasting model using deep learning and fuzzy cognitive map.
2. The aim is to develop and evaluate an advanced convolutional neural network model for pre-detection of control chart patterns in statistical process control.

## Part 5: Research Objectives
- Covers the different aspects of the problem to support the overall research aim and its contributing factors in a coherent way and in a logical sequence.
- Clearly phrase the operational steps to be achieved and thus solve the stated problem.
- Avoid the use of vague non-active verbs (e.g., to appreciate, to understand, to study).

- Communicate to your readers your intention.
- Each objective should contain only one aspect of the study.
- Use action-oriented words or verbs when writing objectives.
- The wording of objectives determines the type of research (descriptive, correlation, experimental) and the type of research instrument to be used.

### Formulating Research Objectives
- Objectives should be listed under two headings:
  - a) 1 main objective (aim/purpose);
  - b) Several sub-objectives.
- The main objective or aim is an overall statement of the thrust of your study.

### How Many Research Objectives?
- Rough guide:
  - For 3-year project: Set 3-5 objectives.
  - For 2-year project: Set 2-3 objectives.

### SMART Research Objectives
- **Specific**: Precise about what you are going to do.
- **Measurable**: Know when you have achieved it.
- **Achievable**: Be able to achieve within time, resources, and expertise.
- **Realistic**: Relevant to your career aspirations.
- **Time Constrained**: Determine when each objective needs to be completed.

#### SMART Words vs Non-SMART Words
| SMART Words | Non-SMART Words |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Identify    | Investigate    |
| Determine   | Study          |
| Derive      | Explore        |
| Assess/Evaluate | Observe     |

### Examples of Research Objectives
1. To propose a new cooperative feature selection scheme that produces the optimum number and combination of features for better classification performance.
2. To improve the effectiveness of pre-detection stage by designing procedures for minimizing the effect of noise, and non-random disturbances on CCPs recognition.

### Tips
- Check and differentiate between objectives and activities (e.g., "To carry out field work" is an activity, not objective).
- Objectives should not involve tasks or activities which are part of methodology.
- Objectives should be to answer (and relate to) research questions.
- It is very important to make sure that Research Questions, Objectives, Methodology are directly related to each other.
- Each research question should be mapped to the objective.

## Part 6: From Problem Statement to Research Questions to Research Objectives
- Research Questions → Change to Research Objectives (e.g., To identify…).
- Answers must be in the related part inside the mind-map of your Literature Review.
- The aims and objectives should answer the research questions.

## Part 7: Research Scope
- Boundary of the study.
- Domain of the data:
  - Time frame of the data.
  - Type of data considered.
  - Attributes to be used.
  - Area of study.
- Techniques to be used.
- Methodology:
  - Approach.
  - Testing/experimental tools/measurements.
  - Test Data.
- Other limits as appropriate to the field of study.

### Examples of Research Scopes
1. This study involves only quantitative forecasting method is employed.
2. There are four different sample sets of multivariate time series data namely China crop yield, KLSE closing price, Composite Index price and Total Export Earnings of natural rubber products are used to validate the performance of our proposed hybrid model.
3. Since linear model such as ARIMA model need at least 50 data points in order to successfully perform the forecasting task (Kang, 1991; Mehdi et al., 2008), we assume that the sample size less than 50 as a small scale data; whereas the sample size that is equal or greater than 50 as large scale data.
4. The data are categorized into simple and complex time series.

1. The models were evaluated based on different datasets: Amazon products reviews and 20-Newsgroup datasets were used for concept drift detection method evaluation. Similarly, Epinions, Baby, and Cell-phone & Accessories datasets were used to evaluate the rating prediction performance.
2. Regarding the distance measures for drift detection methods, four different measures were considered: Hellinger distance (HD), Kullback–Leibler divergence (KD), Total variation distance (TVD), and the Kolmogorov– Smirnov statistic (KS distance).
3. To evaluate the performance of drift detection models, False alarm, Miss rate, and Accuracy were used. While the MAE and RMSE metrics will be used to evaluate the performance of the proposed RS models.

## Part 8: Research Significance
- Why this research is important.
- What the benefits will be and how your work will contribute to knowledge in your field.
- May include commercial benefits.
- New perspective on an old issue.
- Other significant positive impacts to the community.
- Why it is beneficial.
- How it advances understanding of the issues under discussion.

### Examples of Research Significances
1. The process of outsourcing data on the cloud to implement mining operations is greatly beneficial and gets a lot of interests, especially for data owners who do not have sufficient experience with data mining techniques, or do not have sufficient resources towards achieving data protection and privacy.
2. Some of the main reasons for the leakage of data are identity and attribute disclosures. Reducing these disclosures helps reduce privacy leakage and offers a higher level of privacy preservation of outsourced data.
3. Low computational complexity helps improve the efficiency of privacy preservation models implementation. A high performance of privacy preservation processes is crucial, especially since the outsourcing data process requires additional complexity in data processing on the cloud, and in communication.

1. This research would be able to identify the current industry practices, expectations, and requirements from relevant stakeholders on the level of compliance towards Act 709 as personal data protection regulation in Malaysia.
2. By having a valid Data Protection Officer (DPO) framework, this would definitely promote best practices in the organization and subsequently would deter future personal data breaches. In effect, investors will be much more confident and reliable to the Malaysia’s digital economy.

## In Conclusion
### Outcomes
- Must have enough background information in the field of study.
- Good summary of problems indicate significance of the theoretical or practical study.
- Develop testable hypotheses that suggest require further study and experience.

## Cause-Effect (Fishbone) Diagram for Problem Formulation
- A cause-effect diagram (also known as Fishbone or Ishikawa diagram) is a structured brainstorming tool used to explore root causes for an undesirable effect or problem.
- It helps in identifying categories of causes and sub-causes leading to the problem.
- Useful in research problem formulation to break down complex issues, such as in cybersecurity.
