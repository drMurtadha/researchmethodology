## What is Research?
- Research is defined as a process through which we attempt to achieve systematically and with the support of data the answer to a question, resolution to a problem, or greater understanding of a phenomenon (Roscoe, J.T., 1975).
- Research is the method used to accumulate scientific knowledge.
- Seeking through methodological processes to add to existing body of knowledge and, hopefully to that of others, by the discovery of non-trivial facts and insights (Howard and Sharp, 1983).
- Based on intellectual investigation and aimed at discovering, interpreting, and revising human knowledge on different aspects of the world.

## What is the Scientific Method?
- Formulation, testing, and modification of hypotheses (Oxford English Dictionary).
- Systematic observation, measurement, and experiment (Indiana University).

### Research – Scientific Method
- **Observation** (Survey paper, bibliometrics, AI tools): A general problem area (research topic) is defined. Then pertinent observations are made via literature review, discussions and experiments.
- **Problem Definition**: From the observations, specific questions are asked. And the problem to be addressed is defined.
- **Hypothesis Generation**: From the questions asked, researcher makes a specific guess or provide an idea about what is going on. Objectives are defined. Appropriates methods are selected for testing.
- **Testing** (Qualitative, Quantitative, Mixed): Hypothesis is tested through experiment. Data are collected, analyzed and interpreted.
- **Research Evidence**: Hypothesis accepted/rejected or modified. Conclusion is made.

## Important Characteristics of Research
- **Systematic**: Work in a sequence of steps which were in order and thus systematic (Order: Observation, Problem Definition, Hypothesis, Testing, Conclusion).
- **Follows a scientific method of enquiry**: Researcher should not just jump at the conclusions, but used a scientific method of enquiry in reaching conclusion.

## What Research is NOT?
- Research is not information gathering: Gathering information from resources such as books or magazines. No contribution to new knowledge.
- Research is not the transformation of facts: No contribution to new knowledge although this might make knowledge more accessible.
- Research is NOT a SIMPLE Linear Activity: Never more in a straight line. Always loops back & forth. Manage the parts in order to manage the whole. Searching for something you won’t know until you find it. Nobody can solve the world’s great problems in a tiny project.

## Characteristics of High Quality Research
- It is based on the work of others.
- It can be replicated (duplicated).
- It is generalizable to other settings.
- It is based on some logical rationale and tied to theory.
- It is doable!
- It generates new questions or is cyclical in nature.
- It is an activity that should be undertaken for the betterment of society.

## Bad Research
- The opposites of what have been discussed.
- Plagiarizing other people’s work.
- Falsifying data to prove a point.
- Misrepresenting information and misleading participants.

## Research Process
| Component          | Details                                                                 |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Strategies**     | Literature Review, Research Problem/Question(s), Conceptual Framework   |
| **Data Generation Methods** | Survey, Interviews, Design & Creation, Experiment, Observation, Questionnaires, Documents, Case Study, Action Research, Ethnography, Grounded Theory |
| **Data Analysis**  | Quantitative, Qualitative                                               |
| **Outcome**        | Framework, Model, Algorithm, System, Application, Comparative Study, Approach |

## Framework vs Model vs Theory
- **Framework**: Indicates the components, dimensions, and directions of the study prior to methodological approach of the researcher. The perspective you are using to approach research.
- **Model**: Theoretical concepts developed within a framework that underscore the dimensions and components of empirical investigation. Descriptive tool that might help you impose some order on how variables are potentially interrelated so you can begin to formulate questions aligned with your chosen framework.
- **Theories**: Can emerge from models but they are prescriptive, not merely descriptive; therefore, they can be tested.

## Research
- Creation of new knowledge, using an appropriate process to the satisfaction of the users of the research.
- **Everyday Thinking vs. Good Academic Research**:
  - Everyday: Poor data, Incomplete data, Hasty thinking.
  - Good Academic: Sufficient data sources, Appropriate data sources, Accurately recorded, Properly analysed, No hidden assumption, Conclusion well-founded, Properly presented (As judged by the users of the research).

## Basic Research
- Add to our basic knowledge about the world.
- Attempts to shed light on conceptualization about a particular phenomenon.
- Basic research results tend to be generally true but not immediately (if ever) applicable to real world problems.
- Examples: Physicist interested in basic elements of matter; Psychologist shedding light on human cognition.

## Applied Research
- Research have more immediate relevance to existing practice.
- Relates to practical problems.
- Preferred by industry and government as it is likely to have consequences that can be measured in the shorter term.

## Basic vs. Applied Research
- The line between basic and applied research is often fine or missing completely.
- Basic research can often lead to changes in current practices if a connection is made between its result and how things are currently done.
- Applied research often inspires how a basic research problem might be attacked. In either case, both types of problems are valid.

## Unsuitable Problem
- Research is not simply learning about something.
- Research is not the simple comparison of data sets.
- Correlating data sets is not research.
- Research problems do not simply result in a “yes” or a “no” answer.

## Current Researches in Cyber Security

- Recent conference & journal papers (www.scholar.google.com).
- Call for papers.
- Current issues.
- Clients needs.
- To support or refute certain statements (e.g., Green computing is the future; Social networking is the future communication; Baby dumping is the result of new year events).

## Research Methods – Bazara Barry
### Planning Your Research
- The research question or problem.
- The literature review.
- The research proposal.
- Research design.
- Research methodology.

### The Research Question or Problem
- Having an area of interest or research does not signify the actual research question that you will be addressing.
- The aim of a thesis is not mere description; its aim is to provide answers to a question and you need to formulate a question that needs answering.
- Example: Topic like "Internet and Crime" is broad; possible questions: How should Internet crime be addressed? Should government be involved? Which are the most serious Internet crimes?
- Types: Empirical questions (real-world problems); Non-empirical questions (abstract concepts or theories).

### The Literature Review
- Important to identify significant writers and works in your field.
- Find review articles or introductory textbooks for scope.
- Evaluate WWW sources critically.

### The Research Proposal (Brief)
- A planning document that mirrors the basic phases in the research process.

### Research Design & Method
- Explain what you intend to do and ask:
  1. How will you structure your research?
  2. What approach will you be using (quantitative, qualitative)?
  3. Is this the best way to go about answering your question?
  4. What are the assumptions and limitations?

## Research Originality & Contribution
### Originality
- Nine times out of ten, is not about invention but about combination.
- Potential for originality arises by linking ‘ideas’ (‘ways of marshalling the facts to produce arguments, inferences, hypotheses and conclusions’) and ‘facts’ (‘verifiable data’), whether old or new:
  - New facts + new ideas.
  - New facts + old ideas.
  - Old facts + new ideas.
- Research is more than mere experiments -- it means interpretation and deep understanding.
- For Computer Scientists: New abstractions, new approaches, new algorithms, new principles, or new mechanisms; Discovery of new techniques; Uncovering principles underlying digital computation and communication.

### Concept of Originality (Cont.)
- Setting down a major piece of new information in writing for the first time.
- Continuing a previously original piece of work.
- Carrying out empirical work that has not been done before.
- Using already known material but with a new interpretation.
- Trying out in this country that has previously only been done in other countries.
- Taking a particular technique and applying it in a new area.
- Bringing new evidence to bear on an old issue.
- Being cross-disciplinary (integration) and using different methodologies.
- Looking at areas that people in the discipline have not looked at before.
- Adding to knowledge in a way that has not previously been done before.

### Contributions
- Your research should produce something new—These are your contributions.
- Your contributions flow from the answers to your research question and are (often) encapsulated in your thesis statement.
- Contributions are put in the context of existing scientific literature (current practice).
- Contributions made to the field is identified: Gap filled; Inadequacies addressed; Extending the boundary of knowledge.
- Results of research could be applied for practice/in the wider field.
- Implications for future research indicated: New territory; Unfinished business; Extension of Work.

## Research Significance
- Research is more than mere understanding: Requires interpretation; Deep understanding.
- If the results of the research can be predicted, then the research is not significant.
- **Significance (NABC)**:
  - What is a Need?
  - What is your Approach to address the need?
  - What is the Benefit of your approach over cost?
  - In what ways are your research better than the Competitors?
